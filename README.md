# CR10S PRO (V2) - Red Dragon Skin/Theme for TinyMachines Firmware DW7/DW6.2

This is a custom made red/black Skin for the Creality CR10S-PRO (V2). I made it because the stock one looked not very modern in my eyes. The Skin is made with a simplistic and minimaltstic approach, but its still based on the stock Skin of the TinyMachines Firmware DW7/DW6.2. If you find design mistakes or typos please consider contributing a pull request, I will react quickly to any contribution.

## Installation
- Place the DWIN_SET Folder on a Micro-SD-Card
- Power off the printer completely and disconnect it from the grid
- Undo all Screws holding the bottom-plate of your CR10S PRO (V2)
- Insert the Micro-SD-Card into the Micro-SD-Slot on the backside of the touchscreen
- Connect the printer to power again and turn it on, the Display should show a flashing-screen now
- After all Screens were shown on the Touchscreen, power of the printer again and reassemble the printer again
- Enjoy the futuristic new look ! :)
