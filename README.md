# CR10S PRO (V2) - Red Dragon Skin/Theme for TinyMachines Firmware

This is a custom-made red/black skin for the Creality CR10S-PRO (V2).
I made it because the stock one looked not very modern in my eyes.
The skin is made with a simplistic and minimalitstic approach, but it's still based on the stock skin of the TinyMachines Firmware DW7.4.3.
If you find design flaws or typos please consider contributing a pull request, I will react quickly to any contribution.

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PRINTER.
